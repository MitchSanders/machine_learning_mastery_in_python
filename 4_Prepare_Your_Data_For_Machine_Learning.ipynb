    "# Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "><small><i>from the book \n",
    "\"Machine Learning Mastery With Python: Understand Your Data, Create Accurate Models and Work Projects End-To-End\"\n",
    "by Jason Brownlee, Migrated to Jupyter with additions by Mitch Sanders 2017</i></small>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms make assumptions about your data. It is often a very good\n",
    "idea to prepare your data in such a way to best expose the structure of the problem to the\n",
    "machine learning algorithms that you intend to use. In this chapter you will discover how to\n",
    "prepare your data for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. After completing this\n",
    "lesson you will know how to:\n",
    "1. Rescale data.\n",
    "2. Standardize data.\n",
    "3. Normalize data.\n",
    "4. Binarize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Need For Data Pre-processing\n",
    "You almost always need to pre-process your data. It is a required step. A difficulty is that\n",
    "different algorithms make different assumptions about your data and may require different\n",
    "transforms. Further, when you follow all of the rules and prepare your data, sometimes algorithms\n",
    "can deliver better results without pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, I would recommend creating many different views and transforms of your data,\n",
    "then exercise a handful of algorithms on each view of your dataset. This will help you to flush\n",
    "out which data transforms might be better at exposing the structure of your problem in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Transforms\n",
    "In this lesson you will work through 4 different data pre-processing recipes for machine learning.\n",
    "The Pima Indian diabetes dataset is used in each recipe. Each recipe follows the same structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Load the dataset from a URL.\n",
    "-  Split the dataset into the input and output variables for machine learning.\n",
    "-  Apply a pre-processing transform to the input variables.\n",
    "-  Summarize the data to show the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides two standard idioms for transforming data. Each are useful\n",
    "in different circumstances. The transforms are calculated in such a way that they can be applied\n",
    "to your training data and any samples of data you may have in the future. The scikit-learn\n",
    "documentation has some information on how to use various different pre-processing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Fit and Multiple Transform.\n",
    "-  Combined Fit-And-Transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fit and Multiple Transform method is the preferred approach. You call the fit()\n",
    "function to prepare the parameters of the transform once on your data. Then later you can use\n",
    "the transform() function on the same data to prepare it for modeling and again on the test or\n",
    "validation dataset or new data that you may see in the future. The Combined Fit-And-Transform\n",
    "is a convenience that you can use for one off tasks. This might be useful if you are interested\n",
    "in plotting or summarizing the transformed data. You can review the preprocess API in\n",

    "as normalization and attributes are often rescaled into the range between 0 and 1. This is\n",

    "descent. It is also useful for algorithms that weight inputs like regression and neural networks\n",
